  <h1>Reflection Page</h1>
  <p>The aim of this assignment was to create a portfolio website, where I show all the projects that I have done. In my portfolio website there are different section such as home section which contain details about me, a Project section which displays all my projects, a Contact section where you can contact me if there is any issue<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The aim of creating this website is to develop my html, CSS, and JavaScript coding script. Before creating my website, I have done several research to have an overview what is a portfolio. I have checked several portfolios where they have their own design. I have also made some research on W3School where I found some Portfolio template which has help me to create my own Portfolio website. I have chosen a template and apply the same concept. First, I have downloaded all the photos that I will be using for my Portfolio. Then I have created a folder for my image and one for my CSS. To continue I have done a HTML skeleton to have the meta data. Then I have added a navigation bar which contains different section such as Home, About, Projects, Contact detail and Reflection page. Then I have added a hero image which contains a hero text which stated that “This is my website”. Then I have added my Home section which contains a brief description of me and include a photo of me. Then in my project section, there are my 6-projects available. In this section, I have used the grid gallery to display my 6 projects. Moreover, in the Contact Us section, there is you have any issue you can send a mail. During my journey, I have struggled with the JavaScript function. As I had a knowledge of website coding the HTML and CSS was quite easy. Overall, the creation of the website was an interesting experience, where I have learnt lots of things.
